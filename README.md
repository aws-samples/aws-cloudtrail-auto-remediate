## Automatically Enable CloudTrail when Disabled

In this sample, weâ€™ll show you how to deploy and test the CloudTrail logging remediation sample. Amazon GuardDuty generates the finding Stealth:IAMUser/CloudTrailLoggingDisabled when CloudTrail logging is disabled, and AWS Security Hub collects findings from GuardDuty using the standardized finding format mentioned earlier. We recommend that you deploy this sample into a non-production AWS account.
